Its about drive
Its about power
we stay hungry
we devour
put in the work
put in the hours
and take whats ours
black and somoanan in my veins
my culture banging with strange
I changed the game
so whats my mf name
Rock
What they gonna get though?
Desecration, Defamation, If you wanna bring it to the masses
Face to Face now we escalitin' when I have t oput boots to a**es
